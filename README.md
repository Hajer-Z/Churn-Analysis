# Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn**, identifying the reasons behind churn, customer satisfaction scores, and the effectiveness of various offers to retain customers. Using Excel, I explored customer demographics, contracts, satisfaction levels, and conducted regression analysis to understand the factors influencing churn.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze customer churn and identify the reasons behind it.
- To explore the effectiveness of retention offers.
- To assess the impact of satisfaction scores on customer retention.
- To apply regression analysis to identify significant factors influencing churn.

## Data Files and Analysis
1. **telecom customer churn data.xlsx**: Raw data of customer churn.
2. **Churn Analysis.xlsx**: Contains different sheets with the analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Churn Rate**: Approximately 26.5% of customers have churned.
- **Common Reasons for Churn**: The leading reason for churn is competitors, particularly those offering better devices or deals.
- **Retention Offers**: Offers like "Offer A" show a retention rate of 93%, indicating some offers are more effective in preventing churn.
- **Offer Subscription**: A significant number of customers do not subscribe to any offers, highlighting a need to promote subscriptions to retention offers.
- **Satisfaction Scores**: Customers with higher satisfaction scores are less likely to churn, reinforcing the importance of service quality and customer support.
- **Regression Analysis**: The regression analysis suggests a moderate relationship between the analyzed factors and customer churn, with an **R-Square value of 0.438**.
